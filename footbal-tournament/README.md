# React + Vite
Steps:
# First I create a new project using Vite + React

# Now I create a folder named 'data' where I will store a data from csv files. Here I will drag and drop csv files from the task

# Now I create folder 'components' in my 'src' folder where I will store my React components:

1.MatchDetails - this component will show match details including both team and a result
2.TeamDetails - this component will show all players in a roster view with search and filter functionality
3.PlayerInfo - this component will show info about players with their name,position, and number
4.MatchBracket - this component will display each match in the tournament bracket
